        <h2>Parallax Scrolling Effects</h2>
        <p>Parallax scrolling is a powerful technique used not just to make designs prettier, but to engage users. Whilst web design best practice encourages you to place your most important information above the fold,
             a parallax scrolling effect lets you be a bit more imaginative and space out your information. Since the effect itself encourages users to scroll, 
             you can slowly reveal information at a pace that provides more breathing space for your content, while weaving in photos and videos to enhance user understanding of the messaging.

              What Is Parallax Scrolling?<br>
              Parallax scrolling is a powerful technique used not just to make designs prettier, but to engage users. Whilst web design best practice encourages you to place your most important information above the fold, 
              a parallax scrolling effect lets you be a bit more imaginative and space out your information. Since the effect itself encourages users to scroll,
               you can slowly reveal information at a pace that provides more breathing space for your content,
               while weaving in photos and videos to enhance user understanding of the messaging.
              Some elements may move slowly while others may move fast. Generally, objects in the front of a design will move at a quicker rate than those in the background. You can even anchor text or images into place while the rest of the content moves past it. Parallax scrolling juxtaposes the motion of different elements, giving them a sense of physicality and depth.
               <br><br>
              First, it’s an effective way to break out content. If you have a large amount of writing, photos, or other visuals, setting a parallax effect that moves these elements independently from one another prevents them from becoming overcrowded. Using this design technique makes it possible to roll out large amounts of content in a way that’s less hectic than trying to do this all at once. <br><br> 
              Along with an easier-on-the-eyes way of displaying visuals and text, parallax scrolling gives visitors a more dynamic user experience. Moving through a web page triggers multiple points of activity on screen, giving them a heightened sense of visual feedback while scrolling through. This isn’t to say that every parallax scrolling effect is huge, some are more muted, and can be easy to miss if you’re not paying attention. <br><br>
